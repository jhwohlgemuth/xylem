# Xylem Planning Wiki

This directory is the authoritative home for Xylem implementation plans. It follows the Open Knowledge Format layout used by the adjacent ACORN project.

## Contents

- [Plan dependency network](plan-network.md) - Execution order, prerequisites, and shared integration boundaries.
- [Parallel execution guide](parallel-execution.md) - Work lanes, exact ownership rules, and integration locks.
- [Feature plans](features/) - User-facing behavior that completes an existing public interface.
- [Refactor plans](refactors/) - Correctness, security, maintainability, delivery, and documentation work.
- [Migration plans](migrations/) - Dependency and format migrations.
- [Testing plans](testing/) - Hermetic unit, integration, and CLI coverage.

## Next execution phase

Typed execution and resumable execution are complete. The next
dependency-ready runtime item is
[lossless process execution](refactors/process-execution-contract.md), followed
by workflow environment and concurrency. Secure acquisition may proceed in its
separate configuration/acquisition lane.

Memory-aware scheduling remains gated on a successful measurement spike. The [hermetic workflow test suite](testing/hermetic-workflow-tests.md) may continue establishing host-independent fixtures alongside it.

Completed plans are removed, with their landed contracts preserved as prose in
the documents that still depend on them. This includes typed execution,
resumable execution, validated planning, the YAML migration, structured run
reporters, the durable execution journal, fixed input concurrency, and the
ACORN command environment sync. The ACORN 0.3.1 upgrade and hermetic test suite
still carry rechecked current-evidence sections.

## Adding a plan

1. Create one semantically named Markdown file for one atomic topic.
2. Add `type: Plan`, `title`, `description`, `difficulty`, `impact`, a non-empty `package` list, `tags`, and `status` to YAML frontmatter.
3. Use `low`, `medium`, `high`, `mixed`, or `not-assessed` for difficulty; use `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`, `mixed`, or `not-assessed` for impact.
4. Use `planned` or `in-progress` for status. Add `priority: next` only for an immediate candidate.
5. Document the goal, current evidence, project code boundaries, dependencies, recommendation, validation, and acceptance criteria.
6. In project code boundaries, identify files to update, create, and delete. Write `None` when a category is intentionally empty.
7. Add the plan to its directory index, the [plan dependency network](plan-network.md), and a lane in the [parallel execution guide](parallel-execution.md).

## Maintaining plans

1. Recheck evidence against the current source, lockfile, tests, and CI configuration before implementation.
2. Update frontmatter and body together when scope, priority, package ownership, or status changes.
3. Delete completed plans and remove their index, dependency-network, and lane entries.
4. Consolidate overlapping proposals instead of creating competing owners for the same contract.
5. Keep internal links valid and external claims cited.
6. Reconcile code boundaries and integration locks whenever files or modules move.
7. Treat the dependency network and parallel guide as coordination records, not implementation jobs.
